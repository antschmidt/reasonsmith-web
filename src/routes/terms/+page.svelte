			<h1>Terms of Service</h1>
			<p class="last-updated">Last Updated: January 2025</p>

			<section>
				<h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
				<p>

					of Service. If you do not agree to these terms, please do not use the Service.
				</p>

			<section>
				<h2>2. Description of Service</h2>
				<p>
					ReasonSmith is a platform for structured public discourse that combines editorial
					discipline with collaborative features. The Service provides tools for creating,
					publishing, and discussing well-sourced arguments with transparent revision history,
					AI-powered good-faith scoring, Chicago-style citation management, and rich text editing
					capabilities.
				</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h2>3. User Accounts and Authentication</h2>
				<p>
					To access certain features of the Service, you must create an account. We support
					multiple authentication methods including GitHub OAuth, Google OAuth, magic link email
					authentication, and email/password authentication.
				</p>
				<p>You are responsible for:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Maintaining the confidentiality of your account credentials</li>
					<li>All activities that occur under your account</li>
					<li>Notifying us immediately of any unauthorized use of your account</li>
					<li>Providing accurate and current information during registration</li>
					<li>Securing any third-party OAuth accounts (GitHub, Google) linked to your account</li>
				</ul>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h2>4. User Roles and Permissions</h2>
				<p>ReasonSmith operates with a three-tier role system:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<strong>User:</strong> Standard account with ability to create discussions, post comments,
						and receive monthly analysis credits
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Site Manager:</strong> Elevated privileges including content curation,
						dispute management, featured content selection, and moderation capabilities
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Admin:</strong> Complete system control including user management, unlimited analysis
						credits, and full platform administration
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					Role assignments are at the sole discretion of ReasonSmith. Abuse of elevated
					privileges may result in role revocation or account termination.
				</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h2>5. Content Guidelines and Requirements</h2>
				<p>When using ReasonSmith, you agree to:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Provide accurate citations in Chicago style format for all claims and sources referenced
					</li>
					<li>Engage in good-faith discourse and avoid hostile or inflammatory language</li>
					<li>Respect intellectual property rights and properly attribute sources</li>
					<li>Use proper formatting through our rich text editor without attempting to inject malicious code</li>
					<li>
						Not post content that violates our <a href="/resources/community-guidelines"
							>Community Guidelines</a
						>
					</li>
					<li>Not use the Service for spam, harassment, or malicious purposes</li>
					<li>Ensure anonymous posts, if used, still comply with all content guidelines</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					All content is subject to HTML sanitization for security purposes. Certain HTML tags and
					attributes may be stripped from your content.
				</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h2>6. Content Ownership and License</h2>
				<p>
					You retain ownership of content you create on ReasonSmith. By posting content, you grant
					ReasonSmith a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license to use, display, and
					distribute your content on the platform.
				</p>
				<p>
					Published discussions and posts may be featured, curated, or showcased by our editorial
					team through the "Editor's Desk" program. Featured content selection requires author
					approval. You can delete your content at any time, though published versions may remain
					in archives for editorial integrity and version history.
				</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h2>7. Drafts and Auto-Save</h2>
				<p>
					ReasonSmith automatically saves your draft content both locally in your browser's
					storage and on our servers. Draft content is private until you choose to publish it.
					Local draft data may persist in your browser even after you close the application.
				</p>
				<p>
					We retain draft content for a reasonable period to allow you to recover your work. You
					may delete drafts at any time through the Service interface.
				</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h2>8. Editorial Moderation and Featured Content</h2>
				<p>
					ReasonSmith uses a combination of AI-assisted scoring and human editorial judgment to
					evaluate content quality and good-faith participation. We reserve the right to:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Review and moderate user-generated content</li>
					<li>Remove content that violates these Terms or our Community Guidelines</li>
					<li>Suspend or terminate accounts for repeated violations</li>
					<li>Feature or curate content based on editorial criteria</li>
					<li>Require author approval before featuring content on the Editor's Desk</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					Featured content ("Editor's Desk picks") are selected by site managers and require
					explicit author approval before publication. Authors may revoke approval at any time,
					resulting in removal from featured status.
				</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h2>9. Good-Faith Scoring System</h2>
				<p>
					Our AI-assisted good-faith scoring system analyzes posts for constructive discourse,
					proper sourcing, and civil tone using artificial intelligence providers including
					Anthropic Claude and OpenAI. The system:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Performs heuristic pre-checks for content quality</li>
					<li>Evaluates claims, arguments, logical fallacies, and tone</li>
					<li>Assigns scores on a 0-1 scale (hostile → questionable → neutral → constructive → exemplary)</li>
					<li>Provides detailed analysis including claim assessment and improvement suggestions</li>
					<li>May be reviewed and adjusted by editorial staff</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					Scores are advisory and subject to editorial review. Consistently low scores may affect
					your ability to participate fully in the platform. Analysis requires credits (see
					Section 10).
				</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h2>10. Analysis Credits System</h2>
				<h3>Monthly Credits</h3>
				<p>
					All standard users receive a monthly allocation of analysis credits that reset at the
					beginning of each calendar month. These credits are used to perform good-faith analysis
					on your content before publishing.
				</p>

				<h3>Purchased Credits</h3>
				<p>
					When monthly credits are exhausted, you may purchase additional credits. Purchased
					credits:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Do not expire</li>
					<li>Are consumed only after monthly credits are exhausted</li>
					<li>Are non-refundable once used for analysis</li>
					<li>Cannot be transferred between accounts</li>
					<li>Remain with your account even after monthly credits reset</li>
				</ul>

				<h3>Unlimited Access</h3>
				<p>
					Site managers and administrators have unlimited analysis credits and are not subject to
					monthly limits or credit consumption.
				</p>

				<h3>Credit Policy</h3>
				<p>
					Credits are consumed when you request AI-powered good-faith analysis. Once analysis
					begins, the credit is considered used regardless of whether you publish the content.
					ReasonSmith reserves the right to adjust credit allocations, pricing, and policies with
					reasonable notice to users.
				</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h2>11. Citation Network and Data Visualization</h2>
				<p>
					Citations you create may be stored in a graph database (Neo4j) to enable network
					visualization showing relationships between discussions, arguments, and sources. This
					data helps users understand how ideas connect across the platform.
				</p>
				<p>
					Citation data is publicly accessible when associated with published content. You
					acknowledge that citation relationships may persist in the network even if you delete
					individual discussions or posts.
				</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h2>12. Anonymous Posting</h2>
				<p>
					You may choose to post discussions and comments anonymously. Anonymous content:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Does not display your display name or profile information publicly</li>
					<li>Is still subject to all content guidelines and moderation policies</li>
					<li>May be linked to your account for moderation and abuse prevention purposes</li>
					<li>Can be de-anonymized by administrators if required for legal compliance or safety</li>
					<li>Must still meet good-faith and citation requirements</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					Anonymity is not guaranteed in cases of legal obligations, Terms violations, or safety
					concerns.
				</p>
			</section>

			<section>
